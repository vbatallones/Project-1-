## The Memory Game

## How the game works

* When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down.
* The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them.
* If the two tiles have the same image, they remain face up. If not, they should be flipped face down again after a short delay.

## HTML

Add my boilerplate, with my CSS link and Javascript.
My game will be timed which you can see in the `<div>` with a class of **countdown**. The board will be in the center of the screen as well the images. The images will be manipulated by the **DOM** and it will be all in my **JavaScript** file.
